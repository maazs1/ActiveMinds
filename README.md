and share how they’re feeling while spreading information about Mental Health. 

General Run Down of the App and its Features: 
  This application allows users to sign up/sign into their accounts. After signing in, it will redirect the user to their homepage which is there User Page. 
  The User Page displays all of the user’s post, displaying the latest posts first. Users can add more post in this page, swipe to delete posts, or click on 
  the posts to show more details or edit the post. These posts are made up of moods that the user can select supported pictures, comments on how they're feeling,
  and the option to add their location.
  
  This application contains a Feed Page where users can search up and follow other members by sending them a follow request. In this page, users can see the most
  recent post of who they're following. This page also consists of a notification button which when clicked, will display following request from other members 
  where the user has the option to confirm or reject. 
  
  A settings button when clicked shows the user the number of following, followers, and when either the following or followers’ text is clicked, it will display
  a list of usernames. This setting page also allows users to Logout. 
  
  A maps button is also provided which when clicked on the User Page will display all the locations where the user has posted (if locations was selected).
  If the maps button is clicked on the Feed Page, it will display the post location of the members the user is following.
  
  The last feature this application supports is an Interactive Resource Hub. In this Resource Hub, users can choose how they are feeling 
  (from a list of moods supported by images). For each mood which is clicked, it displays the different disorders specific to that mood. 
  The user can click on the disorders to learn more about it. This feature also provides an option to access  information on how/where to seek help. 
  If the user is interested in seeking help, it will display all the nearby facilities with there phone number, address, and there available hours.
